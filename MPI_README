A few things to succesfully to execute mpiexec:
  1. need to include the -host localhost to specify where the sshing is that spawns off jobs to different cores
  2. need to use python3, for some reason the alias isn't working in this command to send python -> python3

mpiexec -n 1 -host localhost python3 MPI_1d_advec.py
